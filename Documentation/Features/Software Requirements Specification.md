## SRS

A **software requirements specification (SRS)** includes in-depth descriptions of the software that will be developed.

* A purpose
* An overall description
* Specific requirements

### 1. Create an Outline

#### 1.1 Purpose

The reason we're developing this project is for learning purposes and to know how software is developed and delivered. 

#### 1.2 Intended Audience

People that wants to share their knowledge and people who wants to learn.

#### 1.3 Intended Use

The use of this document will include software developers, testers and teachers. The document is written as a reference to understand the requirements of this project. It will also be used to gap a bridge between developers, teachers and testers. 

#### 1.4 Scope

"KNet" is an application that matches people that have a skill(teachers) with people that want to learn that specific skill(students). Users will be able to create an account. During account creation, the users will specify which skills they are interested to teach/learn. The users can choose how they want to meet, online or on specified locations. The goal of the project is to create simple way for people to connect and a network for people to meet and learn. The users will be able to advertise what skills they want to teach or learn.

"KNet" is limited to being a skill sharing networking site. It will not supply the means to host a tutoring platform.

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 User Needs

The application will have two different types of users; teachers and students. The teachers must be able to advertise what skills they are able to teach. The students must be able to explore the site for advertised skills that they want to learn. The students can advertise for skills that they want to learn, so that they can find tutors for that skill. 

#### 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

Everyone that will use "KNet" must have access to Internet. We are dependent on users that want to teach their skill. We assume that the people that use our portal wants to teach and learn. We don't host any platform for the users to teach and learn, therefore we are dependent on external platforms for the users to connect or meet for tutoring purposes. 

### 1. System Features and Requirements

####       3.1 Functional Requirements

#####       3.2 External Interface Requirements

####       3.3 System Features

####       3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements

## **User stories** 

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
